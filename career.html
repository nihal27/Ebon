				<p>Have you ever thought about the career guidance? Well! I think majority of students do not consider career guidance a significant issue. Hence, they have no or very little realization about the importance of career guidance</p>

				<p>Choosing a career is not a serious affair until 12th grade. However, once you are done with 12th, it is necessary to choose a definite career and decide a career goal. Choosing the right career option keeping the market in mind is necessary. In addition to this, selecting the right education institution is equally important. Unfortunately, not many students are able to discover their potentials and interests at the stage and this is when pressure starts building</p>

				<p>This is where a Career Counseling plays a pivotal role. So what does Career Counseling involve? Basically, Career Counseling entails the process by which you form a 
                individual aptitudes and personality traits. Every individual is unique, with different areas of strengths and areas of development. A Career Counselor will guide you through process of Career selection. A Career Counselinglor is qualified Consultant / Counseling Psychologist.</p>
